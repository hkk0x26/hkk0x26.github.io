# Gentle Introduction To Mathematics

Mathematics is universal language which touches every aspects of our life, we just cannot even imagine our life without mathematics.  


Being Engineer and software developer, lately realised how much important to understand the fundamentals of Mathematics to understand and solve the complex problems. In other way problems are not complex, it's the approach we choose understand the problem. Mathematics provides the tools which make our life easier to understand and solve the complex problems.  


Many cutting edge technologies, such as Quantum computing, Material Science, Robotics, DeepLearnig and list goes on. which are changing the course of future of humanity as never before are built up the mathematical models. Having good grasp fundamental of mathematics makes us to understand these concept with ease  


## Need Of Mathematics

Mathematics is a universal language. Which being used to express anything and everything in this universe and we are able to express about physical and non physical phenomenon occurring in this universe. without mathematics would have not expressed how this universe is working.

Mathematics is the oldest ancient communication language ever know by humankind. Humans started to use mathematics to communicate even before the human language came into exists.

If mathematics wouldn't exist humans would have not communicated in effective manner as the way do today. Human communication languages evolved  with incorporating mathematics for better and effective communications. Today we use mathematics in our communication day in and day out without knowing that we are using mathematics in our communication.

Mathematical is built upon only two fundamental things **NUMBERS** and **MATHEMATICAL  OPERATIONS** on those **NUMBERS such as +.-,x,/,-.**

Just by knowing **NUMBERS** and **MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS** we can describe any physical phenomenon and non physical phenomenon occurring in this universe.
